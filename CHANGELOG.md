The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.0] - 2025-10-17

### Added

- `--limit` option to `search` command to control maximum number of search results returned
- Default limit of 10 results when no limit is specified
- Input validation for limit parameter (must be positive integer)
- Updated help text with examples showing limit usage

### Changed

- Enhanced search command to pass limit parameter to core kagi-ken package
- Improved error handling for invalid limit values

### Technical Details

- Limit parameter is passed through to core `kagi-ken` package's `search()` function
- Related searches are always included regardless of limit (handled by core package)
- Backward compatible - existing usage without `--limit` continues to work

## [1.5.2] - 2025-08-13

### Fixes

- Fixes broken `package.json` reference which prevented installation

## [1.5.1] - 2025-08-13

### Changed

- **Project Structure**: Moved main entry point from `index.js` to `src/index.js` for better organization
- Updated package.json `bin` entry point to reflect new file location
- Refreshed dependencies in pnpm-lock.yaml

## [1.5.0] - 2025-08-10

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Renamed both the repo `kagi-ken` and the tool `kagi-ken` to `kagi-ken-cli`. Because …
- **BREAKING**: Core functionality has been extracted into separate [`kagi-ken` package](https://github.com/czottmann/kagi-ken)
- CLI now depends on external `kagi-ken` package instead of containing core functionality directly
- Removed `src/web-client.js` - functionality moved to `kagi-ken` package
- Updated CLI commands to import `search` and `summarize` functions from `kagi-ken` package
- Updated dependencies: replaced `cheerio` with `kagi-ken` package dependency

### Enhanced

- **Architecture**: Clean separation between CLI interface and core functionality
- **Modularity**: Core `kagi-ken` package can now be used by other projects programmatically
- **Maintainability**: CLI focused solely on command-line interface concerns
- **Documentation**: Updated all documentation files to reflect new package architecture

### Technical

- CLI maintains identical interface and functionality for end users
- Package dependency uses GitHub repository: `github:czottmann/kagi-ken#1.0.0`
- All existing authentication, error handling, and output formatting preserved

## [1.4.1] - 2025-08-07

### Fixed

- **Summarizer**: Fixed parsing issue where "final:" prefix wasn't properly removed from streaming response messages, causing JSON parsing failures for uncached URLs

## [1.4.0] - 2025-08-07

Renamed both the repo `kagi-web-search` and the tool `kagi-search` to `kagi-ken`. I think it's about time since 1.3 introduced support for the Summarizer, exceeding the initial "search only" scope.

## [1.3.1] - 2025-08-07

### Fixed

- **CLI Binary**: Fixed module entry condition that prevented kagi-ken from running when installed via npm
- **Help Display**: Added automatic help display when no command arguments are provided
- Resolved symlink path differences between `import.meta.url` and `process.argv[1]` in npm installations

## [1.3.0] - 2025-08-07

### Added

- **Kagi Summarizer Support**: New `summarize` command for URL and text summarization
  - Support for both URL (`--url`) and text (`--text`) summarization modes
  - Configurable summary types: `summary` (default) and `takeaway` via `--type` flag
  - Multi-language support via `--language` flag (defaults to "EN")
  - Extracts and returns `output_data.markdown` content as `data.output`

### Enhanced

- Extended `src/web-client.js` with `performSummarize()` function for HTTP/streaming support
- Updated CLI help system and command dispatcher to include summarizer functionality
- Enhanced authentication to work with both search and summarization endpoints

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-04

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Changed CLI syntax from `kagi-ken "query"` to `kagi-ken search "query"` (command-based structure)
- **BREAKING**: Migrated from CommonJS to ES Modules with `"type": "module"` in package.json

### Added

- Command-based CLI architecture
- `search` subcommand with current search functionality
- `help` command supporting both patterns: `kagi-ken help search` and `kagi-ken search --help`

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-03

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Replaced `KAGI_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variable authentication with `~/.kagi_session_token` file-based authentication
- Authentication priority: `--token` flag now takes precedence over `~/.kagi_session_token` file
- Updated CLI help text and error messages to reference file-based authentication
- Improved security by preventing token exposure in process lists and environment variables

### Added

- `readTokenFromFile()` helper function with robust error handling for missing files, permission errors, and empty files
- File-based token storage with automatic content trimming to handle whitespace/newlines
- Enhanced documentation across all project files reflecting new authentication method

### Fixed

- Token authentication now uses more secure file-based approach instead of environment variables

### Documentation

- Updated README.md with file-based authentication examples
- Updated all documentation in `docs/` directory to reflect new authentication method
- Updated CLAUDE.md project guidance with current implementation details
- Added comprehensive usage examples for file-based token storage

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-02

### Added

- Initial release of kagi-ken CLI tool
- Command-line interface using Commander.js framework
- HTML parsing of Kagi search results using Cheerio
- JSON output matching Kagi API schema format
- Session token authentication via `--token` flag or environment variable
- Support for main search results, grouped results, and related searches
- Comprehensive error handling for network issues, authentication failures, and parsing errors
- Complete project documentation and specifications
